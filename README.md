#FizzBuzz Read Me

This here is a simple project based on the children's game "FizzBuzz." 

How it works is simply this: 

A number is given to start and then we count up to that number and each number that is divisible by 3 gets replaces with the word "fizz" and each number divisible by 5 gets replaces by the work "buzz." If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then it gets replaced by the word "fizzbuzz."

The goal here then is to create a program that does just this. 

The input will be a number.

The output will be an array of numbers and strings. The string values will be either "fizz," "buzz," or "fizzbuzz."
